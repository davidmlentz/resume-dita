# resume-dita
This project is an exploration of the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). The .dita files here comprise my resume, and the output directory contains a sample output of this project, as created by [DITA-OT](http://www.dita-ot.org/download). The information in this project is incomplete, but it serves as a practice project for me to extend my experience with DITA.
